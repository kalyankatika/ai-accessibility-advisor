Proof of concept:

Take a web page (in HTML), and evaluate it for a11y compliance
Output a 'report' with issues and recommendations on a11y fixes
How might an AI tool like this have benefits over the CAT tool? Does it adapt more quickly to changes to standards? Provide a more thorough analysis?

Set of instructions/rules for vetting web pages against FDS design specifications. Here are the key guidelines:

 

Core Color Palette:
All green elements on the page must align with the core FDS standards for color.
Use the specified green shades: #36B727, #044014, and #4AD539.
Background Color:
Over 50% of the page must have a neutral (#F9F7F5) background.
White backgrounds are acceptable in some page sections.
Avoid using shades of grey for backgrounds.
Container Styling:
Major content containers (e.g., tiles) must have a corner radius of either 12px or 24px.
Follow FDS standards for shape when applying container styles.
Button Styling:
All buttons on the page must adhere to FDS visual standards for buttons.
Example: Use rounded corners and green fill color for primary action buttons.
Typography:
Ensure consistent use of font styles across different elements (headers, body text, buttons).
Verify that text is legible against its background.
Layout:
Check that the layout is clean and organized, similar to the examples shown.
Ensure proper spacing between elements for readability.
Information Display:
For account balances, use a large, bold font for the main figure.
Display gain/loss information in a smaller font below the main balance.
Navigation:
Include clear navigation elements, such as the "Accounts" header with a back arrow.
Interactive Elements:
Provide obvious calls-to-action, like "Log In" and "Create an account" buttons.
Consistency:
Ensure all pages maintain a consistent look and feel matching these examples.
When reviewing, compare each page against these guidelines to verify compliance with the specified visual standards.
